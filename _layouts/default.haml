              LEVEL UP <strong>TWO</strong><span>Essential skills for future technologists</span>
          %h3 ThoughtWorks' LevelUp program bridges the gap between what is taught at University, and what happens on the ground in software projects. Learn essential skills from people who do this not just <em>for</em> a living, but as a living.

                  Over 9 weeks, you'll deliver a project from start* to finish, guided by highly experienced professionals. We'll teach you everything you need to know along the way, from planning and design to writing and testing your own code. At the end you won't just walk away with working software for your portfolio - you'll have knowledge, skills and experience to hit the ground running in the workplace.
              %p
                :plain
                  Your guides on the journey will be the best software professionals around - delivering software for our clients by day, and teaching you how to do it by night. You can't buy this kind of experience anywhere (and if you could, it would be astonishingly expensive).

                  Availability for the upcoming semester is strictly limited, with only 25 spaces available. Your commitment is the only entrance fee - we want people who are just as passionate about software as we are, and as keen to learn as we are to help! Applications are open now!
